## Learnings

- **React.js Fundamentals**: Strengthened understanding of React basics including component composition, state management (useState, useEffect), user interaction handling, and conditional rendering.

- **API Integration**: Gained practical experience in fetching and handling data from external APIs (e.g., OpenWeather API), improving proficiency in managing asynchronous data in web apps.

- **Backend Development**: Explored building a Node.js/Express.js backend, learning about RESTful API principles, HTTP request handling, and server-side operations like data validation.

- **Styling with Tailwind CSS**: Experimented with Tailwind CSS for diverse styling techniques, creating visually appealing and responsive user interfaces. This enriched my skills in frontend development and UI design.

- **Date and Time Manipulation**: Used date-fns library for date and time formatting, enhancing skills in working with date objects and managing timezones effectively.

- **Error Handling and Debugging**: Refined debugging skills by resolving errors and bugs encountered during development, ensuring application robustness through effective error handling.
